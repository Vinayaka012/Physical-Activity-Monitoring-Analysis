Physical Activity Monitoring and Insights Extraction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning: Conducted a comprehensive EDA on a multifaceted dataset consisting of 18 different physical activities from 9 subjects, encompassing 54 attributes per reading. Identified, addressed, and rectified instances of missing or dirty data to ensure the dataset's integrity for subsequent analysis.

Hypothesis Testing: Formulated and rigorously tested a hypothesis pertaining to the relationship between specific attribute pairs, such as heart rate correlation with activity intensity. Employed advanced statistical techniques to ascertain the significance and relevance of the observed correlations.

Predictive Modeling: Designed and evaluated a multi-attribute prediction model to discern the type and duration of physical activities, incorporating features like heart rate, IMU sensory data, and timestamps. This model aimed to assist in the development of hardware/software solutions for real-time activity recognition and tracking.

Key Technologies: Python, Pandas, Sci-kit Learn, Data Visualization Tools

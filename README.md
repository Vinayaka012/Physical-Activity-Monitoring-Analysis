## Key Features and Analysis üìä

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning**
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a dataset comprising:
  - **18 distinct physical activities** from **9 subjects**.
  - **54 attributes** per reading, including heart rate and IMU sensory data.
- Identified and rectified issues such as:
  - Missing data.
  - Dirty or inconsistent values.
- Ensured dataset integrity for subsequent statistical analysis and modeling.

### 2. **Hypothesis Testing**
- Formulated and tested hypotheses related to:
  - **Heart rate correlation with activity intensity**.
  - Relationships between other key attribute pairs.
- Employed advanced statistical techniques to validate the significance of correlations and identify meaningful patterns.

### 3. **Predictive Modeling**
- Designed a multi-attribute prediction model to:
  - Identify the **type of physical activity** being performed.
  - Estimate the **duration** of activities based on physiological and sensor data.
- Incorporated features such as:
  - Heart rate.
  - IMU sensory data.
  - Timestamps.
- Aimed to assist in developing hardware/software solutions for **real-time activity recognition** and **tracking**.
